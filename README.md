A system which tells whether the person will be save from sinking. What factors were most likely lead to success-socio-economic status, age, gender and more.
Data Understanding
Dataset: Start by understanding the Titanic dataset. It typically includes features such as:
PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger.
Survived: Whether the passenger survived (1) or not (0).
Pclass: Passenger class (a proxy for socio-economic status).
Name: Passenger name.
Sex: Gender of the passenger.
Age: Age of the passenger.
SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard.
Parch: Number of parents/children aboard.
Ticket: Ticket number.
Fare: Ticket fare.
Cabin: Cabin number.
Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).
2. Data Preprocessing
Handling Missing Values: Fill in or drop missing values, particularly for Age, Cabin, and Embarked.
Feature Engineering:
Convert categorical variables like Sex and Embarked into numerical values.
Create new features if necessary, such as FamilySize by combining SibSp and Parch.
Normalization: Normalize features like Fare to ensure they are on the same scale.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyze the impact of each feature on survival. For example:
Gender: Women were more likely to survive.
Class: First-class passengers had a higher survival rate.
Age: Children were more likely to survive.
Fare: Higher fares (indicating higher socio-economic status) might correlate with survival.
Visualize these relationships using bar charts, histograms, and scatter plots.
4. Model Building
Choose Algorithms: Common algorithms for classification tasks include:
Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
Neural Networks (if using deep learning)
Training: Split the dataset into training and test sets (e.g., 80% training, 20% test). Train your model on the training data.
Evaluation: Evaluate the model on the test data using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. Feature Importance
Determine which factors are most influential in predicting survival. Many models, like Random Forests, provide feature importance scores.
Interpretation:
Gender might be the most significant factor.
Socio-economic status (represented by Pclass and Fare) could also be highly influential.
Age and the number of family members on board could play a role as well.
6. Final Model and Deployment
Once satisfied with the model's performance, you can deploy it in a system that predicts survival likelihood based on input features.
Consider building an interactive interface where users can input passenger details and get a survival prediction.
7. Further Improvements
Model Tuning: Use techniques like grid search for hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance.
Cross-Validation: Implement cross-validation to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.
Ensemble Methods: Combine multiple models to create a more robust prediction system.
8. Documentation and Presentation
ReadMe: Provide clear documentation explaining the steps taken, the assumptions made, and instructions on how to run the system.
Visualization: Include visualizations that showcase the importance of various factors in survival prediction.
